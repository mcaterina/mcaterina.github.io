	<h2>Why I like This Movie</h2>
		<p>Little Big Soldier is my favorite movie for many reasons, first is the historical backround in the movie and having 
	it take place in such an interesting area and time period. I also enjoy the scenery and story telling  throughout the 
	movie, but my favorite element of the movie is the Lesson. In the movie the two main characters learn the opposite 
	lesson that some things are worth fighting for and some things aren't worth fighting for. The ending of the movie was perfect, and I 
	may or may not of cried at the end of the movie.</p>
	<h2> Favorite Actor</h2>
		<p>My favorite actor is Jackie Chan who appears in most of my favorite movies. I think Jackie chan is the best actor 
	because of the effort and devotion put into all of his movies. Even in his later movies Jackie Chan denies to have a stunt 
	double even in Little Big Soldier were he is in his sixties, he even broke his hand half way through the movie. Even in 
	the more serious Jackie Chan stars in he always finds a way to implement comedy.<p>
