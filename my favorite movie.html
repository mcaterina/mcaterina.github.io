	<h1> My Favorite Movie </h1>
	<p> Little big soldier is my favorite movie for many reasons, first is the historical bakround in the movie and having 
	it take place in such an intresting area and timeperiod. I also enjoy the scenary and story telling  throughout the 
	movie, but my favorite element of the movie is the moral. In the movie the two main characters learn the opposite lesson that 
	somethings are worth fighting for and somthings aren't worth fighting for. The ending of the movie was perfect, and I 
	may or maynot of cried at the end of the movie.</p>
